A simple game I built while in college called SnakeDuo. It's a simple game similar to the 'Snake' genre of video games where you navigate a snake to eat food while avoiding running into itself or the walls. The twist with this game is that you have to simultaneously control two snakes. Written in Lua with Corona SDK game engine, and a simple Node.js server.
